 ## Description

_Welcome to Shopping List App! This application was created by following along with this youTube tutorial [React JS Full Course for Beginners | Complete All-in-One Tutorial | 9 Hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVFAyFWO4go&t=12666s "Youtube video link") by [Dave Gray](https://www.youtube.com/c/DaveGrayTeachesCode "Link to Dave's youTube") Full credit goes to Dave as the idea and most of the functionality of this application came from his youTube tutorial. I highly recommend this video as he goes over React teaching advanced topics in a beginner-friendly way. I have followed along with this video trying to put my own spin on things, finding different ways to acheive relatively similar results. I had a basic understandig of React before starting this project and have been using the course as a learning/refresher to React. I hope you enjoy following along in my journey to create this simple React application!_
